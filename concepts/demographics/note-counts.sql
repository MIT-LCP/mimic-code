--Title: generates a row for every hospital admission per patient to describe the counts of their clinical notes.
--The statement was created for postgresql and it utilizes a function called crosstab from the tablefunc extension in postgresql. 
--First we add the extension tablefunc to allow us to use the crosstab function in line 10 
--The statement will show the count and the type of clinical notes written for each patient in each hospital admission.
--The prerequisite for this statement is to create  the extension of tablefunc in which we can find crosstab() function.
-- Notes: this query does not specify a schema. To run it on your local
-- MIMIC schema, run the following command:
--  SET SEARCH_PATH TO mimiciii;
-- Where "mimiciii" is the name of your schema, and may be different.
