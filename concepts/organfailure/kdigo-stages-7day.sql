-- This query checks if the patient had AKI according to KDIGO on admission
-- AKI can be defined either using data from the first 2 days, or first 7 days

-- For urine output: the highest UO in hours 0-48 is used
-- For creatinine: the creatinine value from days 0-2 or 0-7 is used.
-- Baseline creatinine is defined as first measurement in hours [-6, 24] from ICU admit
