-- This query extracts the duration of mechanical ventilation
-- The main goal of the query is to aggregate sequential ventilator settings
-- into single mechanical ventilation "events". The start and end time of these
-- events can then be used for various purposes: calculating the total duration
-- of mechanical ventilation, cross-checking values (e.g. PaO2:FiO2 on vent), etc

-- The query's logic is roughly:
--    1) The presence of a mechanical ventilation setting starts a new ventilation event
--    2) Any instance of a setting in the next 8 hours continues the event
--    3) Certain elements end the current ventilation event
--        a) documented extubation ends the current ventilation
--        b) initiation of non-invasive vent and/or oxygen ends the current vent

-- See the ventilation_classification.sql query for step 1 of the above.
-- This query has the logic for converting events into durations.
