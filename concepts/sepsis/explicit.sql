-- This code extracts explicit sepsis using ICD-9 diagnosis codes
-- That is, the two codes 995.92 (severe sepsis) or 785.52 (septic shock)
-- These codes are extremely specific to sepsis, but have very low sensitivity
-- From Iwashyna et al. (vs. chart reviews): 100% PPV, 9.3% sens, 100% specificity
