-- Title: Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)
-- This query extracts the sequential organ failure assessment (formally: sepsis-related organ failure assessment).
-- This score is a measure of organ failure for patients in the ICU.
-- The score is calculated for every hour of the patient's ICU stay.
-- However, as the calculation window is 24 hours, care should be taken when
-- using the score before the end of the first day.

-- Variables used in SOFA:
--  GCS, MAP, FiO2, Ventilation status (sourced from CHARTEVENTS)
--  Creatinine, Bilirubin, FiO2, PaO2, Platelets (sourced from LABEVENTS)
--  Dopamine, Dobutamine, Epinephrine, Norepinephrine (sourced from INPUTEVENTS_MV and INPUTEVENTS_CV)
--  Urine output (sourced from OUTPUTEVENTS)
