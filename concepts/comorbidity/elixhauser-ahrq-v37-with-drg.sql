-- This code uses the latest version of Elixhauser provided by AHRQ


-- first, we convert ICD9_CODE from a VARCHAR to a CHAR(5)
-- this is the format used in the SAS code provided by the AHRQ
-- it makes converting their code to SQL much simpler as we can directly use their syntax

-- also note, that we *cannot* skip this step and use a varchar here
-- why? well, for example, VALVE is coded as BETWEEN '4240 ' and '42499'
-- if we used a varchar, then '4240' *is not* between this range
-- but if we use a char(5), then '4240' *is* between this range
-- and we would like the latter behavior
-- it's possible removing the whitespaces would fix this - but I didn't test it.
-- I prefer consistency with AHRQ.
