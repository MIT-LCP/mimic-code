-- This code calculates the Elixhauser comorbidities as defined in Quan et. al 2009:
-- Quan, Hude, et al. "Coding algorithms for defining comorbidities in
-- ICD-9-CM and ICD-10 administrative data." Medical care (2005): 1130-1139.
--  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16224307

-- Quan defined an "Enhanced ICD-9" coding scheme for deriving Elixhauser
-- comorbidities from ICD-9 billing codes. This script implements that calculation.

-- The logic of the code is roughly that, if the comorbidity lists a length 3
-- ICD-9 code (e.g. 585), then we only require a match on the first 3 characters.

-- This code derives each comorbidity as follows:
--  1) ICD9_CODE is directly compared to 5 character codes
--  2) The first 4 characters of ICD9_CODE are compared to 4 character codes
--  3) The first 3 characters of ICD9_CODE are compared to 3 character codes
