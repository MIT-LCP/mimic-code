-- This code uses the latest version of Elixhauser provided by AHRQ
-- However, it does *not* filter based on diagnosis related groups (DRGs)
-- As such, "comorbidities" identified are more likely to be associated with the primary reason for their hospital stay

-- The code proceeds in two stages
--  (1) convert ICD9_CODE from a VARCHAR to a CHAR(5)
--  (2) remove "primary" ICD9_CODE (seq_num != 1)
--  (3) use AHRQ published rules to define comorbidities

-- note on (1), we *cannot* skip this step and use a varchar here
-- why? well, for example, VALVE is coded as BETWEEN '4240 ' and '42499'
-- if we used a varchar, then '4240' *is not* between this range
-- but if we use a char(5), then '4240' *is* between this range
-- and we would like the latter behavior
-- it's possible removing the whitespaces would fix this - but I didn't test it.
-- This method is also more consistent with the AHRQ SAS code.
