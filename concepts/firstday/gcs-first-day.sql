-- ITEMIDs used:

-- CAREVUE
--    723 as GCSVerbal
--    454 as GCSMotor
--    184 as GCSEyes

-- METAVISION
--    223900 GCS - Verbal Response
--    223901 GCS - Motor Response
--    220739 GCS - Eye Opening

-- The code combines the ITEMIDs into the carevue itemids, then pivots those
-- So 223900 is changed to 723, then the ITEMID 723 is pivoted to form GCSVerbal

-- Note:
--  The GCS for sedated patients is defaulted to 15 in this code.
--  This is in line with how the data is meant to be collected.
--  e.g., from the SAPS II publication:
--    For sedated patients, the Glasgow Coma Score before sedation was used.
--    This was ascertained either from interviewing the physician who ordered the sedation,
--    or by reviewing the patient's medical record.
