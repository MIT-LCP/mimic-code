-- Title: Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria
-- This query extracts the Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria
-- The criteria quantify the level of inflammatory response of the body
-- The score is calculated on the first day of each ICU patients' stay.
-- ------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Reference for SIRS:
--    American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference:
--    definitions for sepsis and organ failure and guidelines for the use of innovative therapies in sepsis"
--    Crit. Care Med. 20 (6): 864â€“74. 1992.
--    doi:10.1097/00003246-199206000-00025. PMID 1597042.

-- Variables used in SIRS:
--  Body temperature (min and max)
--  Heart rate (max)
--  Respiratory rate (max)
--  PaCO2 (min)
--  White blood cell count (min and max)
--  the presence of greater than 10% immature neutrophils (band forms)

-- The following views required to run this query:
--  1) vitals_first_day - generated by vitals-first-day.sql
--  2) labs_first_day - generated by labs-first-day.sql
--  3) blood_gas_first_day_arterial - generated by blood-gas-first-day-arterial.sql

-- Note:
--  The score is calculated for *all* ICU patients, with the assumption that the user will subselect appropriate ICUSTAY_IDs.
--  For example, the score is calculated for neonates, but it is likely inappropriate to actually use the score values for these patients.
