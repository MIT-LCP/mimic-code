-- Title: Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA)
-- This query extracts the quick sequential organ failure assessment.
-- This score was a recent revision of SOFA, aiming to detect patients at risk of sepsis.
-- The score is calculated on the first day of each ICU patients' stay - though needn't be.
-- ------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Reference for qSOFA:
--    Singer M, et al. The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3)
--    Seymour CW, et al. Assessment of Clinical Criteria for Sepsis: For the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3)

-- Variables used in qSOFA:
--  GCS, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure

-- The following views required to run this query:
--  1) gcsfirstday - generated by gcs-first-day.sql
--  2) vitalsfirstday - generated by vitals-first-day.sql

-- Note:
--  The score is calculated for *all* ICU patients, with the assumption that the user will subselect appropriate ICUSTAY_IDs.
--  For example, the score is calculated for neonates, but it is likely inappropriate to actually use the score values for these patients.
