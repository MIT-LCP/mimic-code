# Load MIMIC-IV-ED into a PostgreSQL database

The scripts in this folder create the schema for MIMIC-IV-ED and load the data into the appropriate tables for PostgreSQL v10+.

<!-- 
* You can follow the tutorial to run each file individually. Windows users can follow along [here](https://mimic.physionet.org/tutorials/install-mimic-locally-windows/), while *nix/Mac OS X users can follow along [here](https://mimic.physionet.org/tutorials/install-mimic-locally-ubuntu/)

If following the tutorials, be sure to download the scripts locally and the MIMIC-IV-ED files locally. If you choose the makefile approach, see the below section.

First ensure that Postgres is running on your computer. For installation instructions, see: [http://www.postgresql.org/download/](http://www.postgresql.org/download/)

Once Postgres is installed, clone the [mimic-code](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code) repository into a local directory. We only need the contents of the `mimic-iv-ed/buildmimic/postgres/` directory, but it's useful to have the repository locally. You can clone the repository using the following command:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code.git
```

Change to the `mimic-iv-ed/buildmimic/postgres/` directory. Create the schemas and tables with the following psql command. **This will delete any data present in the schemas.**

```sh
psql -f create.sql
```

Afterwards, we need to load the MIMIC-IV-ED files into the database. To do so, we'll specify the location of the local CSV files (compressed or uncompressed).
Note that this assumes the folder `mimic_data_dir` contains all the `csv` or `csv.gz` files. If using compressed files (`.csv.gz`), use the `load_gz.sql` script instead of the `load.sql` script.

Once you have verified all data files are present, run:

```sh
psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -v mimic_data_dir=<INSERT MIMIC FILE PATH HERE> -f load.sql
```


## Troubleshooting / FAQ

### Specify a database for installation

Optionally, you can specify the database name with the `-d` argument. First, you must create the database if it does not already exist:

```sh
createdb mimic
```

After the database exists, the schema and tables can be created under this database as follows:

```sh
psql -d mimic -f create.sql
```

Finally, loading the data into this data requires specifying the database name with `-d mimic` again:

```sh
psql -d mimic -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -v mimic_data_dir=<INSERT MIMIC FILE PATH HERE> -f load.sql
```

### Peer authentication failed

If you encounter following error:

```bash
psql "dbname=mimic user=postgres options=--search_path=mimic_ed" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f create.sql
psql: FATAL:  Peer authentication failed for user "postgres"
```

... this indicates that the database exists, but the script failed to login as the user `postgres`. By default, postgres installs itself with a user called `postgres`, and only allows "peer" authentication: logging in with the same username as your operating system username. Consequently, a common issue users have is being unable to access the database with the default postgres users.

There are many possible solutions, but the two easiest are (1) allowing `postgres` to login via password authentication or (2) creating the database with a username that matches your operating system username.

#### (1) Allow password authentication

Locate your `pg_hba.conf` file and update the method of access from "peer" to "md5" (md5 is password authentication), e.g. here is an example using text editor `nano`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/postgresql/10/main/pg_hba.conf
```

(Path may change on different postgresql version). Change `local all postgres peer` to `local all postgres md5`.

Restart postgresql service with (command may change depending on system you use):

```bash 
systemctl restart postgresql.service 
```


### NOTICE

```sql
NOTICE:  table "XXXXXX" does not exist, skipping
```

This is normal. By default, the script attempts to delete tables before rebuilding them. If it cannot find the table to delete, it outputs a notice letting the user know.
