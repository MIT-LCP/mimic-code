    "# Generate tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Author: Lawrence Baker\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the code for generating these tables is from work that was previously conducted for a different project by the students of Barbara Engelhardt. This code was modified by the author, but the structure, approach and a majority of the code, including how diabetics are defined, is their creation. Additionally, concepts from the MIMIC code repository (https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code) were used.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code queries a local MIMIC-III install using postgres (via the psycopg2 package). \n",
    "\n",
    "It produces seven dataframes which contain information on: admissions, inputs, charts, labs, icd9 (diagnosis codes), sofa (SOFA scores), blood_labs. These dataframes are saved in a subfolder of the current directory called processed_data in a .pkl. These files are then used by the Glucose Analysis code.\n",
    "\n",
    "These dataframes are extracted in several steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Extracted table generation comprised of 5 steps:\n",
    "1. Define needed inputs (e.g. Insulin) and retrieve the relevant IDs codes from the dictionaries contained in the MIMIC ID tables.\n",
    "2. Retrieve unfiltered tables and use them to define a study cohort of ICU stays. Inclusion criteria for the cohort are: presence in the MetaVision data table, age greater than or equal to 18, an ICU length of stay greater than or equal to 1 day, and at least one glucose measurement\n",
    "3. Filter tables so that they only include the study cohort and the relevant inputs, Sequential OrganFailure Assessment (SOFA) scores, labs and, charts.\n",
    "4. Retrieve the notes of included stays and process to establish known pre-existing diabetic status.\n",
    "5. Append the diabetic information to the extracted admissions table.\n",
