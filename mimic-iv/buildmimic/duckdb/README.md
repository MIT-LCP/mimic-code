# DuckDB

The script in this folder creates the schema for MIMIC-IV and
loads the data into the appropriate tables for
[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/).
DuckDB, like SQLite, is serverless and
stores all information in a single file.
Unlike SQLite, an OLTP database,
DuckDB is an OLAP database, and therefore optimized for analytical queries.
This will result in faster queries for researchers using MIMIC-IV
with DuckDB compared to SQLite.
To learn more, please read their ["why duckdb"](https://duckdb.org/docs/why_duckdb)
page.

The instructions to load MIMIC-IV into a DuckDB
only require:
1. DuckDB to be installed and
2. Your computer to have a POSIX-compliant terminal shell,
   which is already found by default on any Mac OSX, Linux, or BSD installation.

To use these instructions on Windows,
you need a Unix command line environment,
which you can obtain by either installing
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
or [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/).

## Set-up

### Quick overview

1. [Install](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/) the CLI version of DuckDB
2. [Download](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/1.0/) the MIMIC-IV files
3. Create DuckDB database and load data

### Install DuckDB

Follow instructions on their website to
[install](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/)
the CLI version of DuckDB.

You will need to place the `duckdb` binary in a folder on your environment path,
e.g. `/usr/local/bin`.

### Download MIMIC-IV files

[Download](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/1.0/)
the CSV files for MIMIC-IV by any method you wish.

The intructions assume the CSV files are in the folder structure as follows:
    
```
mimic_data_dir
    core
        admissions.csv.gz
        ...
    hosp
    icu
```

The CSV files can be uncompressed (end in `.csv`) or compressed (end in `.csv.gz`).

The easiest way to download them is to open a terminal then run:

```
wget -r -N -c -np --user YOURUSERNAME --ask-password https://physionet.org/files/mimiciv/1.0/
```

Replace `YOURUSERNAME` with your physionet username.

This will make you `mimic_data_dir` be `physionet.org/files/mimiciv/1.0`.

# Create DuckDB database and load data

The last step requires creating a DuckDB database and
loading the data into it.

You can do all of this will one shell script, `import_duckdb.sh`,
located in this repository.

See the help for it below:

```sh
$ ./import_duckdb.sh -h
./import_duckdb.sh:
USAGE: ./import_duckdb.sh mimic_data_dir [output_db]
WHERE:
    mimic_data_dir        directory that contains csv.tar.gz or csv files
    output_db: optional   filename for duckdb file (default: mimic4.db)
$
```

Here's an example invocation that will make the database in the default "mimic4.db":

```sh
$ ./import_duckdb.sh physionet.org/files/mimiciv/1.0

... output removed
Successfully finished loading data into mimic4.db.

$ ls -lh mimic4.db
-rw-rw-r--. 1 myuser mygroup 93G May 26 16:11 mimic4.db
```

The script will print out progress as it goes.
Be patient, this can take minutes to hours to load
depending on your computer's configuration.

On a Fedora 34 workstation with duckdb v 0.2.6 
and a btrfs filesystem with ztsd level 1 compression
it took 16m25s after a fresh reboot
(Hardware: AMD Ryzen 3900X, 32 GB RAM, Samsung 970 Evo NVMe SSD).
