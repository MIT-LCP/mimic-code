-- Title: Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)
-- This query extracts the sequential organ failure assessment (formally: sepsis-related organ failure assessment).
-- This score is a measure of organ failure for patients in the ICU.
-- The score is calculated for **every hour** of the patient's ICU stay.
-- However, as the calculation window is 24 hours, care should be taken when
-- using the score before the end of the first day, as the data window is limited.
-- ------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Reference for SOFA:
--    Jean-Louis Vincent, Rui Moreno, Jukka Takala, Sheila Willatts, Arnaldo De MendonÃ§a,
--    Hajo Bruining, C. K. Reinhart, Peter M Suter, and L. G. Thijs.
--    "The SOFA (Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment) score to describe organ dysfunction/failure."
--    Intensive care medicine 22, no. 7 (1996): 707-710.

-- Variables used in SOFA:
--  GCS, MAP, FiO2, Ventilation status (sourced FROM `physionet-data.mimiciv_icu.chartevents`)
--  Creatinine, Bilirubin, FiO2, PaO2, Platelets (sourced FROM `physionet-data.mimiciv_icu.labevents`)
--  Dopamine, Dobutamine, Epinephrine, Norepinephrine (sourced FROM `physionet-data.mimiciv_icu.inputevents_mv` and INPUTEVENTS_CV)
--  Urine output (sourced from OUTPUTEVENTS)

-- generate a row for every hour the patient was in the ICU
-- here, we generate a starttime/endtime for every hour of the patient's ICU stay
-- all of our joins to data will use these times to extract data pertinent to only that hour
